## What's this?
Found this Toll fee calculator "exercise" and thought it'd be fun to see if I remembered any Scala at all.

Don't expect updates or maintenance of this code...

## How to
Not much can be done but running the tests (`sbt test`)

## Todo
* "In the case of multiple fees in the same hour period, the highest one applies." - Clarification was added after I made this Scala example and is currently not being followed
* Currently only works for one day at the time
